### What I learned


The code below is very instructive:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
    <style>
        .flex-container {
            display: flex;
            flex-wrap: nowrap;
            background-color: DodgerBlue;
        }
        
        .flex-container>div {
            background-color: #f1f1f1;
            width: 100px;
            margin: 10px;
            text-align: center;
            line-height: 75px;
            font-size: 30px;
        }
    </style>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>Flexible Boxes</h1>

    <div class="flex-container">
        <div>1</div>
        <div>2</div>
        <div>3</div>
        <div>4</div>
        <div>5</div>
        <div>6</div>
        <div>7</div>
        <div>8</div>
    </div>

    <p>Try to resize the browser window.</p>
    <p>A container with "flex-wrap: nowrap;" will never wrap its items.</p>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Flexbox is not supported in Internet Explorer 10 or earlier versions.</p>

</body>
